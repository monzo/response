# Response ‚ö°

Dealing with incidents can be stressful. On top of dealing with the issue at hand, responders are often responsible for handling comms, both internal and external, reporting, and coordinating the efforts of other engineers. To reduce the pressure and cognitive burden on its engineers, Monzo built Response to help coordinate and report incidents.

The tool integrates deeply with Slack and revolves around the following ideals:

- **Limit context switching**
  Context switching during an incident is often unavoidable.  Response aims to limit this, by enabling actions to be carried out without leaving the conversation.

- **Make the easy thing the right thing**
  If something needs doing, bring it to the attention of the responder when it makes sense, or better still automate it away.

If you're interested in how we use this tool at Monzo, there's an overview in [this video](https://twitter.com/evnsio/status/1116026261401247745).

# Try it out

Follow the instructions in [demo/README](demo/README.md) to set up an example Django app that uses Response that you can run locally!

---

# Development

## Django
Response is built using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). If you're not familiar with it, there are good [docs here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/).

## Making Changes

- The docker-compose setup maps your Response working directory into the running container.  Any changes made locally will automatically be reflected in the running instance.

- In some cases, it may be necessary to run commands within the container.  This can be done with:

```
docker-compose exec -ti response
```

- If you need to rebuild the app you can use:

```
docker-compose build
```

## Building Blocks

It's likely you'll want to configure Response to support your own environment and processes.  To make this easier, Response provides some useful building blocks in the form of function decorators.

### Incident Commands: `@incident_command`

The `@incident_command` decorator allows you to define a new incident command handler in single function.

**Example** if you wanted a command to show how long an incident had been running you'd simply need to add this one function:

```
@incident_command(['duration'], helptext='How long has this incident been running?')
def update_duration(incident: Incident, user_id: str, message: str):
    duration = incident.duration()

    comms_channel = CommsChannel.objects.get(incident=incident)
    comms_channel.post_in_channel(f"‚è± The incident has been running for {duration}")

    return True, None
```

### Incident Notifications: `@recurring_notification` / `@single_notification`

These decorators allow you to define Notifications which get posted to comms channel as specific intervals.

**Example** if you wanted to remind the engineer to take break every 30 minutes you could define a function similar to the following:

```
@recurring_notification(interval_mins=30, max_notifications=10)
def take_a_break(incident: Incident):
    comms_channel = CommsChannel.objects.get(incident=incident)
    comms_channel.post_in_channel("üëã 30 minutes have elapsed. Think about taking a few minutes away from the screen.")
```

### Keyword Handlers: `@keyword_handler`

These decorators allow functions to called when a specific keyword or phrase appears in a message posted in comms channel.

**Example** if you wanted to remind people where to find your runbooks when they mention 'runbook' you could do the following:

```
@keyword_handler(['runbook', 'run book'])
def runbook_notification(comms_channel: CommsChannel, user: str, text: str, ts: str):
    comms_channel.post_in_channel("üìó If you're looking for our runbooks they can be found here https://...")
```

### Event Handlers: `@event_handler`

Slack can send events for pretty much anything going on in your team. The full list is available [here](https://api.slack.com/events), and new handlers can be added to Response by using the `@event_handler` decorator.

Examples of these can be found in [event_handlers.py](https://github.com/monzo/response/blob/master/slack/event_handlers.py).

### Action Handlers: `@action_handler`

Action handlers are used to handle button presses.  Buttons are assigned IDs when they are created (see [here](https://github.com/monzo/response/blob/master/slack/models/headline_post.py#L57)), and a handler can be linked by simply using the same ID.

```
@action_handler(HeadlinePost.CLOSE_INCIDENT_BUTTON)
def handle_close_incident(action_context: ActionContext):
    incident = action_context.incident
    incident.end_time = datetime.now()
    incident.save()
```
