# Development

## Django
Response is built using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). If you're not familiar with it, there are good [docs here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/).

## Building Blocks

It's likely you'll want to configure Response to support your own environment and processes.  To make this easier, Response provides some useful building blocks in the form of function decorators.

### Incident Commands: `@incident_command`

The `@incident_command` decorator allows you to define a new incident command handler in single function.

**Example** if you wanted a command to show how long an incident had been running you'd simply need to add this one function:

```
@incident_command(['duration'], helptext='How long has this incident been running?')
def update_duration(incident: Incident, user_id: str, message: str):
    duration = incident.duration()

    comms_channel = CommsChannel.objects.get(incident=incident)
    comms_channel.post_in_channel(f"‚è± The incident has been running for {duration}")

    return True, None
```

### Incident Notifications: `@recurring_notification` / `@single_notification`

These decorators allow you to define Notifications which get posted to comms channel as specific intervals.

**Example** if you wanted to remind the engineer to take break every 15 minutes you could define a function similar to the following:

```
@recurring_notification(interval_mins=30, max_notifications=10)
def take_a_break(incident: Incident):
    comms_channel = CommsChannel.objects.get(incident=incident)
    comms_channel.post_in_channel("üëã 30 minutes have elapsed. Think about taking a few minutes away from the screen.")
```

### Keyword Handlers: `@keyword_handler`

These decorators allow functions to called when a specific keyword or phrase appears in a message posted in comms channel.

**Example** if you wanted to remind people where to find your runbooks when they mention 'runbook' you could do the following:

```
@keyword_handler(['runbook', 'run book'])
def runbook_notification(comms_channel: CommsChannel, user: str, text: str, ts: str):
    comms_channel.post_in_channel("üìó If you're looking for our runbooks they can be found here https://...")
```

### Event Handlers: `@event_handler`

Slack can send events for pretty much anything going on in your team. The full list is available [here](https://api.slack.com/events), and new handlers can be added to Response by using the `@event_handler` decorator.

Examples of these can be found in [event_handlers.py](https://github.com/monzo/response/blob/master/slack/event_handlers.py).

### Action Handlers: `@action_handler`

Action handlers are used to handle button presses.  Buttons are assigned IDs when they are created (see [here](https://github.com/monzo/response/blob/master/slack/models/headline_post.py#L57)), and a handler can be linked by simply using the same ID.

```
@action_handler(HeadlinePost.CLOSE_INCIDENT_BUTTON)
def handle_close_incident(action_context: ActionContext):
    incident = action_context.incident
    incident.end_time = datetime.now()
    incident.save()
```
